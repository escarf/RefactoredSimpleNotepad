20: Added an ArrayList containing different subclasses of 'MenuItem' (different subclasses 
	correspond to different items). This allowed menu items to be implemented outside of 
	the 'SimpleNotePadRefactored' class and added to it without any changes to any existing code.

24-33: Changed the names of these fields to more meaningful ones on order to improve readability

34: Added separate methods for all tasks originally completed in the constructor in order to make 
	it easier to maintain these tasks.

63: Refactored notepad no longer has a main method. Instead, the main method is in 'NotePadApp.Java'.
	This is to maintain a distinction between the notepad and a client program that can add more items.

67: Removed the 'else if' blocks that handle the different action commands. Instead, each action command
	is handled by the subclass of 'MenuItem' that corresponds to that item.
